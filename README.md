# Deep Learning: A Mathematical Overview
An overview of deep learning as it is today from a mathematical perspective.
We start with the fundamentals of learning, then go on to analyze how different tasks are learnt, what data 
is used to learn such tasks, and how to better understand said data.
This project is by no means comprehensive. It is intended to simply provide be a high level overview of some of 
the mathematical foundations of deep learning. Feel free to create issues for proposed additions and corrections.
